## Analysis

- `yarn analyze` - See what ESLint and Prettier can fix
- `yarn fix` - Run Prettier and ESLint with the `--fix` option
- `yarn type-check` - Run TypeScript type-check

## Build your site locally

Use `yarn build` to build your site for production - Gatsby has built in support for TypeScript, so no need to do anything special üëç.

## Continuous integration

Github Actions will run on each pull request checking if link, prettier, and TypeScript checks pass.

See the action [here](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Continuous deployment

On each push to `master` Github Actions will run the checks and deploy the site to Github Pages.

See the action [here](../.github/workflows/cd.yml).
